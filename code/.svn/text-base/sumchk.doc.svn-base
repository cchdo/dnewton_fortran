                 Program Sumchk
          WOCE .SUM file format verifier
  
  Program sumchk looks at everything it can in a WOCE .SUM file to see
 if it's correctly formatted. 
 
   execution:
                 sumchk
   program asks for:
                 input (.SUM) filename
                 number of errors to allow before aborting.
 
  
  The program insists on having a standard .SUM file header with the 
 required keywords in it. 
 
    The first thing the program will tell you is if you're missing any
 standard keywords. If you already know it's not there then okay, but
 if you see it's missing an important parameter like STNNBR then you've
 done something wrong.  It also checks for two different types of 
 bottom_depth and notes if they're missing. Don't take this to mean that
 you have to include both corrected AND uncorrected depth.
 
   Does not check to see that you've used proper cast_type or
 navigation codes. (but does check their size)
 
   See woce_sum.notes for help in forming a correct .SUM file.
