                           Proogram cvuwoce
    Converts historical units in WOCE format hydro data to /KG units.
 
 
   A small percentage of WOCE format hydro data is submitted with oxygens
 (both bottle and CTD) in ML/L and with nutrients in UMOL/L.  This program
 will detect and convert data in /L units and convert them to /KG units.
 
  Usage:   cvuwoce
 
  Program asks for:    input filename   (.HYD or .SEA file)
                       output filename:
                       if bottle oxygens:
                           were oxygens whole bottle or aliquot 
 
  notes:
          Input format is assumed to be correctly formatted WHP data
          Data columns identifiers and units strings must be correct
            and in upper case.  ie.  oxygens are ML/L
          Oxygen conversion uses sigma T for density. T is set at
            25 C for aliquot oxygens and when T is missing.
