                 Program Seaorder
      Sorts WOCE .SEA files into ascending pressure order.
 
     This program reads WOCE format .SEA or .HYD files and sorts the
  station/casts into ascending pressure order. Program looks at CTDPRS only,
  *not* REVPRS. 
 
     This program should be run before wocecvt if there are pressure inversions
  or if pressures are listed deepest first.
 
   execution:
                       seaorder
 
   program asks for:
                       input filename
                       output filename
 
 
     Uses the same routines as wocecvt for figuring out the headers. So
  bad headers may choke.
     Levels with the same pressure should remain in the same order after
  sorting.
     Program trims off extra characters (like "^M") from the end of each line.
