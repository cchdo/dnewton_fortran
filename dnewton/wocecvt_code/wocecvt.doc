                     Program wocecvt
   Converts WOCE format hydro data to more familiar formats
                       David Newton
 
    Program wocecvt was written to convert WOCE format data (.SUM file +
  .SEA or .HYD file) to more familar hydrographic formats using historical
  units.  It also goes through great pains to verify that the data files
  are readable and as such is also intended to be used as a format verifier.
    Program is written in completely standard Fortran 77.
 
  Execution:
           wocecvt
 
  Program asks for:
           input .SUM filename
           input .SEA or .HYD filename 
           how you want quality codes interpreted (3 choices)  see below
           whether to look at QUALT1 or QUALT2
           output format  (1=IEH, 2=SD2)
 
    Three different ways of treating quality codes are possible:
 
 1.  DQE mode.     Accept ALL data (qual=2,3,4)
    If it's missing it's missing, if it's there it's good. 
 
 2.  Picky mode.   Accept only good data (qual=2)
    Missing, bad, and questionable data will be considered missing.
  
 3.  Archive mode. Uncertain codes will be preserved.
    Bad (qual=4) data will be considered missing.
    Questionable data (qual=3) 
       With IEH format  All parameters can hold an uncertain code.
       With SD2 format  Temp, sal, and oxygen can be marked as uncertain.
                        Other nutrients will be reported, but without
                          quality codes because SD2 doesn't allow them.
 
     
     In all but DQE mode a missing bottle salt will try to substitute a
     CTD salt.
 
    Conversion of oxygen and nutrients from WOCE units to historical units
  will take place unless the indicated (3rd line of .SEA file) units contain
  the string "/L".
 
    If .SUM files contain corrected bottom depth then they will be used.
  Uncorrected bottom depths will be corrected using carter tables.
 
    Errors encountered will be printed out as they're detected, usually with
 a record number. A standalone program for verifying the .SUM file is
 available. That program is called sumchk.
 
    .SEA files that have reversed pressures or big pressure inversions
 can be fixed with program seaorder.
 
    Station/casts that had duplicate depths will print out at the end of
 the program. It is your responsibility to fix these.
 
    If you chose IEH format you have the option to add any value in the
  .SEA file into the 3 wild columns that IEH format allows.
  Specify what values you want in a file called 'wildcol' in the working
  directory.  The 'wildcol' file contains exactly 3 lines and is read with
  fortran format (a7,1x,i1).  Here's an example:
 
          CFC-12  3
          CFC-11  3
          NONE 
 
    Start in column 1 with the official WOCE parameter name.  Use the word
    NONE to specify nothing needed in that wild column.  Column 9 of the
    file is the number of decimal places to use in IEH format for that
    parameter.  
    Don't make a 'wildcol' file if you don't want to bother with wild columns.
