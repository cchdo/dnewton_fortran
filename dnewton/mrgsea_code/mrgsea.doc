                        Mrgsea
        Merges new data into an existing WOCE format .SEA file
 
   Program mrgsea adds or replaces data into an existing WOCE format
  .SEA or .HYD file. 
 
   Program will query user for filenames and options.
 
   Notes:
    Existing .sea file is assumed to be correctly formatted.
    Program merges one parameter per run. 
    The new input data file is read with a user supplied fortran format
      specification.  (will not read comma delimited "free" format)
     
   Matching options.
   5 schemes can be used to match samples.
          1. STNNBR, CASTNO, SAMPNO
          2. STNNBR, CASTNO, BTLNBR
          3. STNNBR, SAMPNO
          4. STNNBR, CASTNO, CTDPRS
          5. STNNBR, CTDPRS
    Scheme #1 is the best.
 
 Fortran formatting.
     You'll be asked early on to supply a valid fortran runtime format
     for reading the new input data file.  A crude template will be
     given to the user based on the matching scheme selected and the
     number of accompanying quality flags.
 
     Given this new data,
  STNNBR  CASTNO  SAMPNO  CFC-11  CFC-12  QUALT1
                         PMOL/KG PMOL/KG       *
                         ******* *******       *
     999       1       1   1.588   0.994      28
     999       1       2   1.592   0.984      28
 
    and using matching scheme 1 and having 1 quality flag
    The following format would read CFC-11 and its quality flag.
    (a8,i8,a8,f8.0,8x,6x,i1)
     decoded this means: first 8 chars contain character data.
                         next 8 chars contain 1 integer.
                         next 8 chars contain character data.
                         next 8 chars contain a real.
                         skip 8 chars
                         skip 6 chars
                         next character contains 1 integer.
 
    An equivalent using t format would be: (a8,i8,a8,f8.0,t47,i1)
    The last integer would be read from exactly column 47.
 
    "t" format will be used when your input new data file doesn't
       have the various fields in the exact order mrgsea expects. 
       for example this file:
 
  STNNBR  CASTNO  CFC-11  CFC-12  SAMPNO  QUALT1
                 PMOL/KG PMOL/KG               *
                 ******* *******               *
     999       1   1.588   0.994       1      28
     999       1   1.592   0.984       2      28
                        
       Would be read with: (a8,i8,t33,a8,t17,f8.0,t47,i1)
