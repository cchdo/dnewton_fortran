                     Program wctcvt
   Converts WOCE format CTD data to a more workable format

    Program wctcvt was written to convert WOCE format high resolution
  CTD data to a more workable format. It can also be used as a WOCE
  format verifier. 
    Output is a single file containing all the stations, with 
  header information accomapnying each cast. (DCF format) (used in ctdsearch)
    Program is written in completely standard Fortran 77.
 
  Execution:
           wocecvt
 
  Program asks for:
           input .SUM filename
           a file containing all the .WCT filenames
           how you want quality codes translated (3 choices)  see below
           whether to look at QUALT1 or QUALT2
           Originators country code. (not ship country)
           output filename
 
    Three different ways of quality codes translation are possible:
 
 1.  DQE mode.            woce     dcf
                          1-4       1
                           5        0
                          6-7       1
                           9        0
 
 2.  Picky mode.          woce     dcf
                          1-2       1
                          3-5       0
                          6-7       2
                           9        0
  
 3.  Archive mode.        woce     dcf
                          1-2       1
                           3        3
                          4-5       0
                          6-7       2
                           9        0
 
  dcf quality codes are:
 0==missing  1==okay  2==interpolated  3==questionable
 
     
 
    If .SUM files contain corrected bottom depth then they will be used.
  Uncorrected bottom depths will be corrected using carter tables.
  Unknown type of bottom depth in .SUM file is assumed to be corrected.
 
    Errors encountered will be printed out as they're detected, usually with
 a record number. A standalone program for verifying the .SUM file is
 available. That program is called sumchk.
 
    See dcf.doc for the specification of DCF format.
